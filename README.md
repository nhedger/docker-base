# Base Docker Image

![build](https://github.com/nhedger/docker/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

This repository contains a base docker image that I use for creating other
docker images.

- ðŸ§± Based on [Debian (slim)](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian)
- ðŸ‘® Sets up [S6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) as the
  process supervisor
- ðŸŽ¨ Sets default environment variables to match my preferences

## Usage

To create a custom image that builds on top of this base image, extend from `hedger/base`.

```dockerfile
FROM hedger/base
```

Refer to the official [documentation of s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#usage) for instructions about creating services.

## Building

This base image is automatically built and released using GitHub Actions.

To build the image locally, run the following script.

```bash
docker build -t hedger/base .
```
